	Introduction
	</h1>
	<p>In our generation, social media has become one of the main sources of communication for humans all around the globe. Over the years we have seen some new attempts or iterations of social media, but many have fallen off (i.e. MySpace, MSN) or other platforms have taken over. For example, Tiktok took the concept of Vine and recreated a similar platform and has made great success with 680 million active users as of November 2018. Other social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have remained at the top for several years now. Throughout this webpage, we will be discussing the pros and cons Instagram and Tiktok. Brian will be arguing for Instagram and Artem will argue for Tiktok.</p>

<h2>
	Why Instagram is Better than Tiktok (Brian On #0885147)
</h2>
<p>		Instagram has been around ever since they were launched in 2010. It has become the #1 photo sharing platform over the past several years with consistent positive changes. One of the biggest announcements Instagram did back in 2012 was merging with Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg saw the Instagram as a future potential threat. He would further pursue more acquisitions in 2014 by buying WhatsApp. Ever since then, Instagram continued to grow in popularity throughout the years playing a major part of competition for other platforms such as Snapchat. With the recent rise of Tiktok, it seems Zuckerberg is now faced with more competitors. However, with Tiktok being relatively new, Instagram is still the larger audience with 1.8 billion having at least downloaded it. Although Tiktok has reached 1.5B downloads (2019) within such a short amount of time, we should consider the COVID-19 outbreak for it is possible rise in popularity. The longevity of Tiktok is also questionable. Similarly, Vine had produced a platform of the same concept back in 2012 however was later discontinued by Twitter due to monetization issues. With Tiktok being a newcomer to the market, it is unsure of how well they can actually keep up when compared to Instagram which has been established as one of the main sources.

<p>		When comparing the two in terms of what they offer, Instagram offers a photo sharing service among friends and followers while Tiktok offers short clips ranging from dancing to acting skits and more. Due to this, the content consumption of Tiktok is way to fast and the semantic load of the content falls. It is rise in popularity has also created a contrast of many unentertaining clips with people posting almost anything (as long as it meets the TOS) in attempts to gain internet fame even if it’s completely unentertaining. You could say the same for Instagram, but I think Instagram does a better job at maintaining what you see as it bases it algorithm off who you follow or accounts you view the most so your feed is usually photos of people you enjoy seeing. Another disadvantage of Tiktok is the audience. The main audience for people using Tiktok are kids so you see the same issue that happened with Vine where ads cannot be played due to the children. This is extremely different from Instagram where “influencers” are able to make money through sponsors and posting photos. Overall, Instagram is just a more complete social media platform in my opinion. With the ability for those to create careers off photos, it is also just much more attractive to someone looking to use a social media platform. The UI is also much more clean and with the audience being children, there is a high possibility Tiktok falls off similarly to Vine overtime.

	<h2>There are 5 main reasons</h2>
		<p>
			Why Tik-Tok is better than Instagram?
			<br>

First of all TT(Tik-Tok) provides an interface and functions that are very easy to work with. It is easier for people to create content even if they don't have any skills in editing videos. Also, TT has free music to use and users can easily put it in there without any problems with copyright. 
<br>
<br>
Another plus of TT is algorithms. TT has different algorithms than Instagram, TT helping young bloggers to earn new subscribers for free. And after your success in Tik-Tok, you can move your subscribers to other platforms like Instagram or youtube. On the other hand on Instagram, algorithms would not allow you to have a big flow of subscribers to your account so, you need to pay a lot of money to other bloggers and Instagram to get new subscribers. 
<br>
<br>
A third big plus is donations on streams. Like on youtube or twich people can send you money during live translations. This gives new bloggers a big motivation to create content and it is always good to get some extra money))

One of the main features of TT is trends. It is dace, move, challenge, or basically anything that is going viral on this platform. When a new trend is created everybody are filming it but, the main criteria is creativity. So, basically, if you are repeating this trend in the most creative form or you have a good chance of getting a lot of new subscribers.
<br>
<br>
For the last advantage, I will talk about 2 things. The first one is the main audience of Tik-Tok and the second one is the length of the video.
So, the main audience is children, and to create content that children would love you don't need a big effort. It can be the most primitive jokes or just stupid videos and the shorter and the funnier the video is the better result would be. For example on youtube best length of the video is 10-13min on Instagram is 1min-45sec and on Tik-Tok is 13-8 seconds!!!
Basically, the author must tell a 10 minutes story in 15-sec max (also you can record 1 min videos but they are not so popular) the author must interest the person and give him emotion (any emotion) in 15 sec! some times it is pretty difficult but, this gives an ability to consume content really fast and people can watch more videos per day. More videos per day-more subscribers and views.
<br>
<br>
So this is why Tik-Tok can be better than Instagram and I think that that is a social media platform of the future just not everybody can accept it. Remember how people were talking about Instagram 10 years ago?
